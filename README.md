## Jason Sonith — CS Undergrad (May 2026) | Cybersecurity Focus

I’m a Computer Science undergrad (3.9 GPA) graduating **May 2026**. I’m strengthening my cybersecurity skill set through **Python scripting** and hands-on **security projects**—from log analysis and IDS/IPS labs to python scripting.

### Experience
- **Cybersecurity Intern — Mobile Health Infirmary (Healthcare)**  
  Helped migrate on-prem → AWS; built Python scripts for log triage; supported network monitoring and access control.
- **Research — Phase Space Algorithm to Detect Malware**  
  - Applied a phase space algorithm to detect anomalies in a system behavior in different malware families, identifying anomalies in system behavior.




### What I’m doing now
- **Security Projects:** Python tools for log parsing, IOC enrichment, and alert triage.
- **IDS/IPS Lab:** pfSense + Suricata with EVE-JSON logs (Kali → pfSense → Ubuntu).
- **Cloud:** Learning AWS (IAM, EC2, S3, GuardDuty, CloudTrail) and baseline hardening.

### Interests
Endpoint & network detection, SIEM pipelines, threat emulation labs, and blue-team automation.

### Toolbox
**Python, PowerShell, Java, C++** · pfSense/Suricata, Splunk, Nessus, WireGuard · Windows Server/AD, Linux · **AWS** (IAM, EC2, S3, GuardDuty, CloudTrail, Config)

### Certs
CompTIA Security+, CompTIA CySA+, AWS Cloud Practitioner
